# Lake-Tahoe
Simple website on Lake Tahoe, CA to practice some basic CSS. 

This is a landing page I created as a basic review of some CSS concepts. It is part of the Team Treehouse Front End Development curriculum. 

I found it to be an excellent learning experience for a lot of CSS concepts I didn't have too much exposure with before, like transparent overlapping backgrounds and box shadows.
